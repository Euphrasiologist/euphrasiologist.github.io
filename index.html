  <h1>Overview:</h1>

  <p1>This proto-website is the outreach for some of the work I have been doing, why I think it's interesting and how you could do the same thing too! I'm a firm believer in data, code and workflow transparency. Github is an incredible tool for this, as well as learning to code at the same time.</p1>

  <h1>About:</h1>

  <p1>My name is Max and I am a postgraduate researcher at the University of Edinburgh, working on some plants in the British Isles called Eyebrights (or Euphrasia). I am using common garden experiments, field observations, some statistics and genomics to understand how hybrid species might evolve in Euphrasia.

  I also in general love plants.</p1>
