    <h1>New website</h1>
    <small>[<a href='../2021.html#new-website'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='new-website.html'>standalone</a>]</small>

    <p>The motivation for this stripped back website, is that running Jekyll was becoming really annoying to sync
        between
        separate computers. And it's probably unneccesary for what I wanted. As I wanted to do some easy blogging
        (nothing
        major), I came across <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">this</a>. It's a little shell script which
        will
        create and publish blog posts from the terminal. I intend to mock them up in VSCode, as nano isn't going to cut
        it
        for me. I'm on a Mac, so the script won't work properly without GNU sed - there is somehow a difference between
        the two. I later have learned that Macs have ancient versions of GNU coreutils (~2005?).</p>

    <p>As for the blog executable, it's really nice!</p>

    <code>./lb n # makes a new post</code>
    <br></br>
    <code>./lb p # publishes a post</code>

    <p>As for the blog, I don't really know what I'll do yet. But I may shove some of my D3 visualisations on here,
        talk about bits of code that I like. Or plants I like.</p>
