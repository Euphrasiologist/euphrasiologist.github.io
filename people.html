      <p>I'm a biologist interested in plant evolution. My honours degree was in Biological Sciences at the University
        of
        Oxford (2013-2016), and my PhD at the University of Edinburgh with Alex Twyford as my supervisor (2016-2020). I
        then moved to Cambridge where I was a Senior Bioinformatician in the Blaxter Lab at the Wellcome Sanger
        Institute.
        After a short career break, I have returned to academia and currently hold a position as a Lecturer of Plant
        Ecology and Genetics at Anglia Ruskin University in the School of Life Sciences.
