    <h2>Opportunities</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately ARU is not part of a DTP currently, but this may change soon. We have competitive budgets for a
      limited number of PhD students however. If PhD's are advertised, they will always be on findaPhD.com.</p>

    <h3>General opportunities</h3>
    <p>I would be glad to be contacted from anyone who is interested in plant ecology, genomics, or the intersection of
      these topics. I am happy to try and advise for sources of funding, and potentially write grants with keen
      prospective students, should the opportunity arise.</p>

    <h3>Collaborations</h3>
    <p>I am always open to collaborations with folk, and I'm grateful to the many collaborators who have worked with me
      over the years.</p>
