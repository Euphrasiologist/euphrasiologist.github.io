    The motivation for this stripped back website, is that running Jekyll was becoming really annoying to sync between
    separate computers. And it's probably unneccesary for what I wanted. As I wanted to do some easy blogging (nothing
    major), I came across <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">this</a>. It's a little shell script which will
    create and publish blog posts from the terminal. I intend to mock them up in VSCode, as nano isn't going to cut it
    for
    me. I'm on a Mac, so the script won't work properly without GNU sed - there is somehow a difference between the two.
    I
    later have learned that Macs have ancient versions of GNU coreutils (~2005?).

    As for the blog executable, it's really nice!

    <code>./lb n # makes a new post</code>
    <code>./lb p # publishes a post</code>

    As for the blog, I don't really know what I'll do yet. But I may shove some of my D3 visualisations on here, talk
    about
    bits of code that I like. Or plants I like.
