        This isn't my CV yet, I'm working on it...

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>I studied Biological Sciences at the University of Oxford (2013-2016), and then completed my PhD at the
            University of Edinburgh (2016-2020). My thesis looked at taxonomic complexity in eyebrights
            (<i>Euphrasia</i> species) and in the wider British Flora. It's not yet on Google Scholar, but you can
            download it from my public GitHub repo <a
                href="https://github.com/Euphrasiologist/Thesis/blob/master/MBrown_Thesis_all.pdf">here</a>.</p>
